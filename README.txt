Fuck Securly, this is a beta version. The main point of this is to allow for the embedded access to games during school. This is unbockable, and as a result an OP fix. I will continue updates through the end of senior year (2021) and most likely never touch it again. Feel free to edit my code and give feedback.

(Also I wrote Beta 1 in a 40 minute study hall period so if it looks bad in the early release that's why.)







Usage Agreement:

By using roms you accept total responsibility for the file. I did not create any of these games and the source files are not my own. I personally own all of the games I have roms for, and by downloading said roms you certify that you do as well. I do not proft from any of this and never plan to. I also do not own the source emulator software, and have simply embedded it using the process outlined by the owner. This is intended for use by myself and other students of Duxbury High School, for recreational purposes only.
